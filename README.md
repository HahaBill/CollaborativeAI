# CollaborativeAI

## Assignment 1 : Negotiating agent

Negotiation is a form of interaction in which a group of agents with conflicting interests strive to reach an agreement over an outcome [1, Chapter 4].
Negotiation is fundamental to collaborative AI because often agents cannot fully accomplish their objectives on their own and need to exchange resources with each other.

The negotiation will run using the GeniusWeb framework and the setup is based on the rules from the International Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC) [3].
It will be a bilateral negotiation between two agents, using the Stacked Alternating Offers Protocol (SAOP). Negotiations are conducted using various multi-issue preference domains,
which are described by additive weighted utility functions.
